# crispy

Cross platforms clipboard command-line. This project provides 2 programs:

* `crispc` for copy to clipboard.
* `crispp` for paste content from clipboard.

## Why I creating this tool?

Currently, each clipboard uses this tools:

* `pbcopy` and `pbpaste` on macOS.
* `clip` and `paste` on Windows.
* `xclip` and `xcel` on Linux.

Those tools above uses the same tool, same process, but different name. I don't
want to remember all of this. ><
